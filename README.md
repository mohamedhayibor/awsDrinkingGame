AWS Drinking Game ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-green.svg)
----

If you are hitting the AWS console a lot, what would be more than fun than guessing the different logos while getting wasted. So pressure off from the pain of programming and have fun with your fellow engineers or even play the game alone while getting sips of your favorite wine (or refreshment :smile:).

### ChangeLog:
1. set up dev environment (done)
2. create react components
3. Make it work
4. Make the design even more slick

![Tj's joke](http://res.cloudinary.com/masteryoperation/image/upload/v1459909468/AwsJoke_zvsv1b.png)

When Tj made the joke, I was like: "Ok, it is time to get to work".

See how well you can do. The good part is that all logos are made up of amazon boxes :smile:.
