AWS Drinking Game ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-green.svg)
----

If you are hitting the AWS console a lot, what would be more than fun than guessing the different logos while getting wasted. So pressure off from the pain of programming and have fun with your fellow engineers or even play the game alone while getting sips of your favorite wine (or refreshment :smile:).

## Rules of the game

> Every time you guess wrong (the logo disappears), you drink. When you guess it right, the next player takes the turn.

## Raison d'être

![Tj's joke](http://res.cloudinary.com/masteryoperation/image/upload/v1459909468/AwsJoke_zvsv1b.png)

When Tj made the joke, I was like: "Ok, it is time to get to work". Procrastinated then rushed up to finish for once.

See how well you can do. The good part is that all logos are made up of amazon boxes :smile:. Also note that the game doesn't end. So basically play until everybody has gone to bed or someone calls the ambulance.
